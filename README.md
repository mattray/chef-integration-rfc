# Chef Integration RFC

The repository for proposals for integrating external technologies with Chef-related projects.

## Usage

* Create a markdown formatted file in the top level with the name of your proposal, e.g. `space-travel-resource.md`.
* Describe how this change would work; examples of resource usage, expected behavior with unexpected data, etc.
* Push to your GitHub fork of chef-integration-rfc and open a pull request.
* Send an email to the [chef-dev mailing list](http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/info/chef-dev) with an explanation of your proposal and include a link to the pull request.
* Discuss. Stew for a week to provide ample opportunity for discussion.
* Once consensus is reached, the chef-integration-rfc maintainer (initially Matt Ray) will merge your proposal and assign it the next available RFC number.
* If you have any questions feel free to email Matt Ray (matt at getchef.com) for assistance.
